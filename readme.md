# Final Project For Iron Hack Data Analytics Bootcamp
This is the repository for my data analytics bootcamp final project

# Scraping
To scrape news articles, there are two relevant classes...

# TODO:

# 1. Get better metadata:

## a) Categories: categories can come from one of two places. The url tag (/deportes) or the xml sub page

## b) Check name of publication, make sure it is what I am looking for (for each publication)

## c) Author: Implement some better functinoality to scrape authors when they are not listed in XML feed.

## d) Country, CITY, Of publication (Perhaps)

# 2. Implement more custom trimming of specific pages (like using .decompose) or doing some additional string maniuplation for speicif pages. This could live for example in the daily_scrapper class for example and be entered as a parameter when constructing the class.

# 3. Think a littl more about uniqueIDs and how they are being used

# 4. Refactor to pep standards for variable names etc.

# 5. Vasly scale up periodicos being scraped

# 6. Deploy scraper to cloud.
